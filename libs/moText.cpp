	{1000,"Hi!#n#nI have a cousin, who can teach you all there is to know about building houses. I can give you directions to him, if you help me out a little.#n#nFirst bring me some clay. Then as a reward I will teach first you how to soak the clay in water to prepare it for making bricks.#n#nThen when you have advanced a little and reached level 4 you can come back to me for more lessons."},
	{1001,"Hi again!#n#nI need you to show me that you have learned your lesson from last time.#n#nIf you can soak the clay well and are patient enough to show me what you made, as a reward I will teach you how to actually make bricks from soaked clay and also how to make mortar.#n#nThen when you have advanced a little and reached level 6 you can come back to me for more lessons."},
	{1002,"Welcome back!#n#nSo, back for some more? Again I need you to show me that you have learned your lessons from last time.#n#nBut since I also need to build a house for my Aunt, I need you to deliver the items to me this time. Just showing me the items is not going to help you anymore.#n#nWhat I need is some brick and a little mortar and as a reward I will teach you how to create fasteners and clips out of iron. You know how to smelt don't you?#n#nThen when you have advanced a little and reached level 8 you can come back to me for more lessons."},
	{1003,"Welcome back again!#n#nHave you then learned about smelting and a little blacksmithing? How admirable. The kids nowadays don't seem to be too interested in hard work.#n#nI believe in you and I am ready to consider sending you to my cousin. I could use your help though before that. I am still working on my Aunt's house; she is being impossible.#n#nCould you bring me some more bricks and mortar? Also, just to practice your blackmisthing, please bring me a few of those clips and fasteners too.#n#nWhen you are back I will teach you the first step toward masonry. To be more clear I will teach you about brick elements.#n#nThen when you have advanced a little and reached level 12 you can come back to me for more lessons."},
	{1004,"Welcome back!#n#nI have to admire your enthusiasm. My cousin is called Kelemen and he is not living very far away. But on second thought I still am not sure if I can tell you his whereabouts. However if you are helping me to finish this house I am building to my aunt, I will give you the directions.#n#nWhat I still miss is a few of these brick elements. Please bring me some, so I can get rid of my aun't complaints in the near future.#n#nWhen you are back I will teach you how to make cornerstones, without this knowledge my cousin wouldn't talk to you anyway."},
	{1005,"Welcome back again!#n#nYou have been heping me a lot and proven me also that you can learn easily. Kelemen, my cousin, will like such a student as you are. Although you can't go to him yet, because we have not yet been practicing carpentry at all.#n#nWhat you will need is learning all about housing logs, panels and beams and eventually doors. I can teach you how to make all these, but I am not going to be able to do it, if my aunt will kill me. Yes, that blasted house is still not ready. I need some cornerstones, a little more mortar and a few fasteners.#n#nPlease bring me few of these items, so I can live without my aunt threathening me every day reaching old age.#n#nWhen you are back I will teach you some carpentry skills."},
	{1006,"Hello again!#n#nThanks to you, my aunt's house is nearly finished. She is easing up also, so I can focus on your teachings again. Before Kelemen, my cousin, will be able to accept you as one of his students, there are a few things still I need to explain to you.#n#n#n#nPlease bring me some housing logs, panels and a few iron clips to finish my housing project.#n#nWhen you are back I will have one last task for you."},
	{1007,"Hi again, welcome back!#n#nFinally I was able to finish my aun't house but she didn't like it in the end. She said it was a sad try on my part and she would go and ask my cousin, Kelemen to build a decent house for her. I am not sure how I feel about all this, I am a bit shaken and I think I need to warn my cousin. I know Kelemen will not want to go through all that, maybe he can hide from my aunt. Therefore I will need to teach this last thing that is left for me to teach and send you off to him, before he disappears from Three Lakes. Yes, that is where you can normally find my cousin and it is Three Lakes you will need to go to continue and finally learn all there is to learn about housing projects.#n#nBefore you visit Kelemen in Three Lakes, I have to teach you about doors and door parts. Unless you don't want people wander in hour home, you will want to lock it with a fine door.#n#nPlease bring me a few pine beams to show that you are ready for this final knowledge.#n#nOne last thing, you will need to be at least around level 30 for Kelemen to be able to teach you."},
	{1008,"Hi there!#n#nSo, my cousin, Hertbert sent you then. Hmm..., interesting, how is he doing? Last time I heard from him he was trying really hard to be like me. Well, if he has taught you already everything he knows (or was able to learn), I can train you further.#n#nI have a few items I would require from you before I will help you learning the tricks of building houses.#n#nAfter this task is completed I will help you, but you will need to advance a little in this hard world before that. Come back for more of my teachings when you reach level 33."},
	{1009,"Have you heard from my cousin lately? He was supposed to visit. Not that I complain, he is annoying and he thinks he knows so much.#n#nNow that you can do basic masonry and you fulfilled my first request so nicely, I am willing to teach you more. However you also need to practice a little carpentry to advance in your expertise.#n#nI would need you to craft a few items and show their quality to me before any serious work.#n#nPlease come back when you have all needed items and I will reward you with a craft scroll that will teach you how to make a Sturdy Pine Door."},
	{1010,"Hello sweety!#n#nI am in a good mood today, so I am willing to give you something pretty sweet as a reward if you do a few things for me.#n#nI would like you to kill some rock elementals for me, gather crystals and make something sweet. As a reward I will teach you how to infuse your crappy wood axe."},
	{1011,"Welcome sweetypie!#n#nI have been eating a lot of cake lately, which makes me smile. And something else:#n#nRoses are red,#n#nViolets are blue,#n#nI am feeling happy#n#nand you will be too.#n#nI am willing to teach you another sweet thing, but you will need to shed some sweat before I will help you to infuse your rusty pickaxe."},
	{1012,"Hi!#n#nNice to see a friendly face around. I think we haven't met yet, I am Rose and I live around here. I know this town is not much to look at, but it is all we have left after the disaster.#n#nWe are cursed. Yes you heard well, WE ARE CURSED! Can you help?#n#nPlease!"},
	{1013,"I am so glad that you are back!#n#nI don't remember anything about last night. I did have a strange dream, but all seemed to be in such a blur.#n#Thank you for your kind help with those nasty creatures. They showed up after the wizard cursed us, I hope lessening their numbers will help.#n#I would like to ask you to track down my brothers Pete and Pate. They were effected by the curse longest and I am afraid there is nothing we can do about it, but release them from their suffering.#n#nWill you help? Please bring me evidence of their demise."},
	{1014,"I feel so wretched about my brothers' fate, but I owe you. Your last actions seem to be lessening the strenght of the curse around this place.#n#nI think by getting rid of the evil, it might help us all. Would you like to take on yourself the task of making this place less dark and dangerous?#n#nYou can help by bringing me some soup to fortify myself against the hunger of the zombies, maybe it will make me feel better too. Then face the evilest of the evil, my Nana... She was the one who convinced the wizard to act and it is unforgivable. But before that something has changed her. It is terrible to see her like this, in the end it will be better if we let her reach her final rest.#n#nYou will find her around this town during the night, when the zombies come out to roam around."},
	{1015,"I noticed that the curse weakens, but strangely I feel worse every day. I think I have another being living inside me, one which seems to take over during the night.#n#nI would be eternally grateful to you if you would help us to get rid of this curse fully.#n#nI am afraid that you need to find out what is causing me feel like this and then you will need to get rid of my Nana's lover too, the one who brought all this pain down on us, the wizard. He is named Ymdar and he is hiding well, but during the nights he cannot hide anymore.#n#nIf you help to find what is making me ill and then finish of the wizard's zombie form, I think we will see more clear."},
	{1016," Your last actions were considerable lessening the strenght of the curse around this place.#n#nEven now that the wizard'd zombie form is no more, there is something which is still keeping this curse here. Would you like to take on yourself this last task of making this place less dark and dangerous?#n#nI am sure now that to finally be able to get rid of all the bed things happened to us requires to hunt down the evil wizard's servant, or what's left of him. You will see him walking around here, like he owns this place, a big mean skeleton.#n#nIf you help I will make sure that you will be well rewarded, I have a key that my Nana used to wear around her neck, but she dropped it sometimes ago and I hid it. You can have it after all this is over."},
	{1017,"Hi!#n#nMaybe you can help me. Only if you want of course.#n#nI have grown fond of a girl who lives close by in a small village. She used to come here to buy eggs and other provisions for her Nana, but I haven't seen her for quite a while. I cannot imagine how they get by.#n#nPlease look her up and talk to her."},
	{1018,"Hello, did you come here to wish me happy birthday?#n#nI know something sweet I am sure you are dying to know yourself too. But I need to make all this juice and cake for my party, have no time to teach you.#n#nWhat??? Are you willing to do that for me? Fantastic!#n#nPlease do the things on my list for me and this sweet knowledge to infuse that sharp sickle will be yours forever."},

	{1020,"Hi!#n#nYou have managed to get your hands on something valuable. And I can see that you have no idea how valuable this piece of broken mask is. You have at least noticed it was broken, haven't you?#n#nI have a few ideas how to mend this mask, but I have never seen it done myself, this is a very rare item you found there. If you are successul, this mask will aid you on your tarvels.#n#nDon't get too excited, this will not be an easy thing to do and you will need either yourself to learn some craftsmanship or have a friend who knows a few things about actual work.#n#nRight, let's get to it. First, I think you need to practice mining and mine some green jade stones."},
	{1021,"Hi!#n#nThat was impressive mining before. Finding so many green jade stones, you were very lucky. But unfortunatelly this doesn't seem to be enough. I am sorry for the false advice.#n#nYou should go back now and mine some more.#n#nIf we double the stone need and if this time you also collect some white jade stones and some gold ores, it might just be enough to start with."},
	{1022,"Hello stranger!#n#nI am in dire need. I promised my girlfriend a delicious gift for tonigh. It is our anniversary and I cannot, simply cannot, make a mistake.#n#nI need still a few flowers and some of the most tasty and exquisite mushroom. If you help me, I will give you something you will value highly."},
	{1023,"Hi!#n#nSorry, I am in a hurry!#n#nWhat??? You say that my gift from last time is useless? Oh! How nasty!#n#nWell, you could actually help me out a little. My girlfriend's mother is hard to satisfy when it comes to my dinner conversation, she calles me daft and boring! ME!!!! She is escorting her daughter to our date, .... again.... I am afraid it will not go the way I would like it to go,... again....#n#nBut now that you are here, I have a few ideas. Help me, will you? If you do, I will show you how wonderful the knowledge you got from me the last time really is."},
	{1024,"Hi my friend!#n#nYes, yes, I know. You are not my friend, I am just so happy!#n#nI am sorry if I am a bit over excited. It's just that my girlfriend finally agreed to meet me for dinner without her mother this evening.#n#nI would like to decorate the table with some flowers, help me and I will tell you one more of my secret recipes."},
	{1025,"Hi!#n#nI think the materials are now collected. At least i think so, although it is posible I forgot something.#n#nHowever it is time you start working on these raw materials.#n#nMelt the ore to ingots and polish the jade stones. Come back when you are done."},
	{1026,"Hi!#n#nIf you like shiny things and if you would like to get impossibly rich with not so hard work, then you are talking to the right person.#n#nWell of course for you learning what I know will take some time and you are not going to get rich tommorrow, but if you listen to me and learn what I can teach you, you will get there for sure. Or at least you will be wearing shiny things.#n#nOkay my dear. First buy some of my recipes and craft some tin ingredients. I will reward you well."},
	{1027,"Welcome back!#n#nI know tin jewelry is not too shiny and a bit rough looking, but you cannot start working with the best materials right away, there is a long way ahead of you until you learn this craft my dear. Please be patient and start paying attention.#n#nYou seemed to be getting on fast, so let's jump on to copper. You will need to craft some copper ingredients, but you can find all the needed recipes from my store. Come back to me when you are finished and I will give you the secret of copper shinies."},
	{1028,"Hi again!#n#nNice work on those copper jewelry! I am sure you will do a clean and fast work on the following tasks too.#n#nThis is going to be easy for you my dear, although you will need to practice a bit of alchemy and make some glass.#n#nMake beads from glass and some of the tin ingredients then come back for the knowledge of your first set of jewelry with a little glass stones."},
	{1029,"Hi my dear!#n#nThe first set of glass jewelry is good, but there is more to learn my dear.#n#nYou will be required to do similar work than before, except this time, we start practicing with silver.#n#nShow me again some of those nice little beads you have crafted and the work on those silver parts and I will teach you how to make another set of jewelry with glass beads."},
	{1030,"Hello!#n#nI knew my dear that you will back, but I haven't thought that it will happen this fast! Nice to see you being so eager to learn.#n#nWell there is one more set of these glass bead jewelery, this time out of silver.#n#nShow me again some of those nice little beads you have crafted and the work on some more silver parts and I will teach you how to make the last set of jewelry with glass beads."},

Maybe my tasks were not too hard to complete after all.#n#nLet me think on this for a little, ....#n#nI will need some jewelry myself, so from now on showing me the goodies will not be enough. You will need to deliver!#n#nLet's start then my dear. I have some knowledge on crafting nice silver jewelry. I know of three silver sets I can teach you.#n#nBut first bring me silver jewelry adored with some of those glass beads.I will need a few of each."},
	{1032,"Welcome back again!#n#nBack to learn more my dear? That is admirable of you. One so young and so hungry for knowledge.#n#nWell there are two more silver sets and I am sure it can be useful to learn how to craft them.#n#nFor me to teach you the secret of this second silver set, I will need a few of each of the first set. Bring them back to me, then you will receive what you are after."},
	{1033,"Hi dear!#n#nSo, you are back to learn the secret of the last silver set. For you this is a known task now, nothing new.#n#nI will teach you how to make the last set of silver jelwery, just bring me some of the crafted jewelry you learned just before. You know the drill.#n#nThis will be all you can learn here, to continue on your voyage of getting impossibly rich you will need to visit Three Lakes and look for a jeweler there."},
	{1034,"Hello!#n#nI heard you would come here. From where? A little bird told me my dear....#n#nWell, yes I can teach you how to craft shiny jewelry with precious stones. You heard the rumours then. I am the best when it comes to this town.#n#nBring me some silver jewelry, my favourite is hammered silver. In return I will teach you about carnelian, how to use it and the best way to put it on silver."},
	{1035,"Hello my dear!#n#nI really liked the work you have done with those hammered silver jewelry, especially liked the bracelets. I liked them so much that I gave them to my friends and family members as presents. Of course I told everyone that they were made by you, don't you worry.#n#nNow I can teach you how to work with amethyst as the next step. Amethyst jewelry is slightly different from carnelian, not so much in quality as in the way this precious stone behaves.#n#nI am sure you learned my lessons for carnelian, but just to be on the safe side, I would like you to bring me examples once more before we proceed."},
	{1036,"Hi again!#n#nI really like your work so far and I am honored to call you my student. I have kept all the carnelian pieces you have given me so far, I really like them. I will add them to my collection from my students. Maybe one day you will run into them in an exchibition.#n#nNow. The new stone I could teach you about is ruby. It is again a bit similar with silver as amethyst and carnelian were, the jewelery is about the same quality but the outcome is different. You will see my dear that many people will find them more useful than the others.#n#nSo, practice a little on amethyst and then you will understand better what I mean.#n#nBring me some of your work soon."},
	{1037,"Hello there!#n#nSweet! I like it when people are hungry for knowledge and willing to work for it. I can see you belong to this group.#n#nYou deserve my help to learn something sweet. Yes, ... something sweet ... you heard me well. No, this has nothing to do with sweets, go talk to the cook about cakes, pies, muffins or juices. My knowledge is something you cannot eat, but it is sweet when you own it.#n#nOkay, I am going to need you to prove yourself first. I am sure you knew this was coming though and you are prepared.#n#nGo farm a little and bring me back some sugar. I want to ask the cook out and sugar is always a good gift with her. Ah yes, please also kill that huge fungi which is popping up here and there, this so called lord makes it really hard sometimes for me to get around."},
	{1038,"Hi!#n#nMy dear you have proven yourself master of the material we call silver. There is nothing you could learn more, not around here at least. However there is a long road ahead of you until you can call yourself a master of the art.#n#nI can start teaching you about gold. Are you ready?#n#nWell then, all you need to do for the first step is to show me that you have a certain amount of gold ingots."},
	{1039,"Hello again!#n#nHave you tried to work a little on gold yet? No? have you thought you don't need the practice? Well my dear, you do. Gold is much harder to work on than silver was.#n#nNow you should work on the gold, so I can teach you more. I need you to make and then show me some gold sheets."},
	{1040,"Hi my dear!#n#nNice to see you being this eager. I am sure you really would like to craft your first gold jewelry by now. Working with gold is making people to want shiny things even more and get riches beyond imagination.#n#nI am not making fun of you, don't worry, I know very well what you are going through. I am sure you will cherish all the knowledge I got to teach.#n#nI am going to need you to give me some of the gold ingredients when you are back next time. I can use them myself, they will come in handy. When you are back, I am going to teach you the basic gold set."},
	{1041,"Hi again!#n#nThat was very nice of you before, nice and good quality work. I can really use those gold ingredients, I have some birthdays incoming soon in my very very extended family. I am not sure I will have time to teach you at all, but at least I got some of the things, thanks to you, to start working on the gifts expected from me.#n#nOf course if you are willing once more to give me some of your best works, I will have time to teach you.#n#nOkay, no more talking then, bring me two full sets of those basic gold jewelry I taught you and then I will show you all there is to know about the pure sold set."},
	{1042,"My dear!#n#nI have been expecting you. You have no idea how much my twin cousins liked their birthday gifts! They said that they never had so beautiful gold jewelry before. Well they were living far away, only recently moved to this area, so this was the first gifts they got from me really.#n#nThe next birthdays coming are my younger sister's and my aunt Lilly's. They both got basic gold sets last year, so your helping me would come in handy.#n#nI am afraid it will be two full sets again, but this time the pure gold set. Bring them back to me and the secret of making a real good hammered gold set is yours. I promise.#n#nHowever this is the last thing you can learn from me, you should look for the master jeweler, named Mama Jo to learn more. I can assure you, that although she has a nasty personality, she is real good in what she does."},
	{1043,"What???#n#nWho told you to come to talk to me and disturb me while I am doing my thinking?#n#nI will have to have a little chat with Melody, that little pain in my lower half thinks she is so special, while even her name is one of the stupidest names I have ever heard.#n#nListen darling, I do have immense knowledge when it comes to working with gold. I have been working with gold all my life, not that I am that old ...! Mind what you are going to say to me or I will ignore the hair off your back.#n#nIt must be hard to believe but I don't really trust anyone, and you don't exactly look like someone with a lot of talent either.#n#nTo start earning my precious trust, bring me back some of your work, make it medalions. I will reward you, that is a promise.#n#nNow get lost...!"},
	{1044,"You!#n#nThose medalions you gave me were not of the finest work you know, but maybe I can fix them up and use them later, but maybe I just throw them away.#n#nListen to me you little wanna be a famous jeweler. Bring me back some gold jewelry now and better make them of your best work!#n#nMake it be hammered gold pieces as your next task and I might just teach you something more about sodalite, every casters friend.#n#nWhat are you standing around, go get to it then!"},
	{1045,"Back then? It took a long time!#n#nI don't remember when someone made sloppier work than you and I have taught a lot of wanna be jewelers.#n#nI don't like your attitude either, so you have a lot to prove.#n#nI don't have time to chat now, just bring me back the sodalite stones and medalions, now beat it."},
	{1046,"The polished stones will be good for some second grade items, but you will have to make better quality work from now on.#n#nI heard Melody is trying to teach again someone, I think her teaching can't possibly produce a worse outcome than you were... . Am I putting too much pressure on you? #n#nHah! Why do I even ask, it's not like you would tell me the truth right to my face?!... Anyway, I don't really care what people think about me, I am good in what I am doing, if you want to learn, fine. I will use time on you. But please do your best!#n#nThe sodalite jewelry I want from you now must be excellent work or I keep throwing away expensive materials and for what?#n#nAre you slow or what? Get to work!"},
	{1047,"Listen to me!#n#nI start to think you can't do better than you are already doing. It's a shame, people nowadays just don't really try to make an effort.#n#nAlthough I got to hand in to you that you don't seem to be the quitter. You look like one though. But you keep coming back.... And that was the nice thing for me to say today. I promised my sister that I will try not to make people cry so much, she cannot take the sad faces anymore. Well, that was what she said. Frankly, if someone cannot take it, then it is better if they just go hide behind a sand dune.#n#nIt doesn't matter what you think, you need the practice. So start practicing on black onyx and bring me the evidence. I believe it when I see it.#n#nJust run along and start working!"},
	{1048,"You don't give me much peace do you? Is there noone around here you want to talk to? Why is it me always?#n#nI know how to stop you coming back here. So because I am now really tired of seeing your face, I will teach you all I got. Maybe that will keep you away from me. FOREVER!#n#nBut since I don't really believe you can do it, you will need to bring me back proof. And it is better be your own handywork! I hate cheaters maybe more than quitters.#n#nGet out of my face!"},
	{1049,"Hello my friend!#n#nI am the only scribe around here and I am the only one who can help you learn the mysteries of making paper. You will see that this knowledge is really useful in your adventures soon. Of course it will not help you to slain spiders, but stomping will not help with the bigger spiders either.#n#nYou will need better spells and this is where the secrets of making paper can be very useful. Paper is used to work on those spells you need later.#n#nNow, please bring some wood pulp and bleaching extract and I will teach you what you need. Yes it is simple, isn't it?
